# Self-Balancing-Robot-Design
A Self Balancing Robot is a robot that is capable of balancing itself or rather achieving stability on its own whenever an external unstability is introduced to the system. The project consists of a two-wheeled self-balancing system built using a multilevelled chassis and various off-the-shelf components like Arduino Uno, motor Driver, LiPo Batteries, DC motors etc.
